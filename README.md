# About
A small personal project I worked on around 2017 when I was a sophomore in college.  It's a little roguelike "game" in the vein of Nethack, although I never got past generating a level.  It does generate things.  Just not well.

This was made on a Linux machine, so it needs to be run on Linux.

# Running the Game
Just ls to the directory and run the roomgen2 executable.  To move around, you'll  have to type w, a, s, or d and hit enter.  Tiles are drawn as they come into the player's field of view.  Tiles that have been discovered but aren't in the field of view are gray.

To quit, type q and press enter.
