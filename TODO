WORLD GEN
Idea 1:	Points
	Randomly generate an exit at coordinates (x, y) that is a certain distance away from the player spawn (within reason)
	Randomly generate n nodes around the world within a certain distance of the player spawn and the exit
	Randomly connect points together with a path and assign the path a random weight; n paths max for each node; all paths must be connected
	Create a min spanning tree from the nodes
	Following the min spanning tree we generate, calculate the paths between each node in the world (this will probably be diagonal geometrically)
	Following each path between nodes, generate rooms and hallways that are only vertical or horizontal until we connect the nodes
	Do this for each node?
